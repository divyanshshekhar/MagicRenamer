# MagicRenamer
You can rename a number of files at once using this Java based tool. You can perform renaming operations such as removing or adding a bunch of characters at the start of the file.

The tool is planned to be upgraded to support more modifications such as at the end or middle of filename and also replace patterns of characters.

Prerequisites-
1> Any version (Java 2 or later) of JDK or JRE must be installed.
2> Supports all operating system that have JDK or JRE installed.

How To Run-
1> Open command prompt (for Windows)
2> cd to (goto) the bin folder where MagicRenamer.jar is kept.
3> Type 'run' and hit Enter. Note: skip the quotes (').

   path where files to be renamed are kept along with the renaming criteria
   i.e. the modifications you want to make.
